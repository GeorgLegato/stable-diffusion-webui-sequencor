# stable-diffusion-webui-sequencor
An extentsion for StableDiffusion WebUI - Automatic1111 and VladmandicÂ´s cut.

It takes any image sequence and process *some* interpolation between them in order to generate animations into movie file.

First processors will be Google F.I.L.M to interpolate semantically between images in a soft way.
Second idea is to have the interpolation routine from InfiniteZoom on board, to rework/rerun a video if there small glithces to be fixed.
